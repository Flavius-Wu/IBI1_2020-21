Interpretation:
The more identical the two sequences are the greater the blosum number, "Percentage of identical amino acids' and "Alignment_number" will be.
The biological funntion for SOD2_human(NP_000627.2) and SOD2_mouse(NP_038699.2) are largely similar.
It shows that there is an evolutionary relationship between human and mouse.
However, the biological funntion for SOD2_human	(NP_000627.2) and RandomSeq, SOD2_mouse	(NP_038699.2) and RandomSeq are different.
but the instrution did not say whether the random seq. is SOD2 or not
so, it is hard to make judgement on evolutionary relationship between human mouse and random.
